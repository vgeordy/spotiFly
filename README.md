# spotiFly
Your one-stop stop for categorizing playlists like a pro.

## What?
spotiFly is a webapp that allows you to connect your Spotify and create/curate playlists based on selected properties in your liked songs, such as how "danceable" a song is, the genre, the BPM, etc. 

## Why?
Music streaming is great, but organizing all your liked songs into playlist can be quite the task! spotiFly promises to help you out on this by automating exactly that, and unleashing you from the chore that being an active listener of music entails.

## How?
spotiFly uses the Spotify API and logs into your account to facilitate all of this. The Spotify API allows us to get specific details on tracks, such as the danceability, key, and BPM, and using that info we can create playlists on your behalf quicker than you ever could.
